## About me


> As a self-taught developer I had the chance to broaden my horizon by learning on Udemy, Egghead, Frontend Masters, 
Wroclaw meetings, publishing platforms like Medium, or MDN Web Docs. 
That enabled me to work in a great software development company.


Before that, I worked as a sales representative. It is amazing how many people I have met have needed websites or mobile applications. I started learning and discovered my passion for front-end stack. While learning I enjoy development more than my earlier job, the time in this sector greatly improved my overall experience and skills.
